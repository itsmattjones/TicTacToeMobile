# TicTacToeMobile

## Summary
This is a expanded cross-platform mobile version of the TicTacToe game found here: https://github.com/MattOnCode/TicTacToe. It includes both singleplayer modes with seperate difficulties, and multiplayer modes for local co-op.

The application is built on the concept of MvvM (Model-View-ViewModel), with the core of the code held in the TicTacToe project and the appropriate resources for each mobile platform held in their respective projects (TicTacToe.Android / TicTacToe.IOS).

As a licence is required to distribute the apps, and due to them being open source there are no releases on any app stores. However, there are android releases under the releases section of this Github project. Just download the APK and run it on your phone.
